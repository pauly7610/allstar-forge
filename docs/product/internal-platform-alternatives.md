# Internal Platform Alternatives Analysis
## Allstar Forge vs. Current State Solutions

### Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates current approaches to analytics infrastructure provisioning at Allstate and demonstrates why building Allstar Forge as an internal developer platform delivers superior outcomes compared to maintaining the status quo or implementing alternative internal solutions.

### Current State Assessment

#### Status Quo: Manual Provisioning Process
**Current Approach:** Platform Engineering team manually provisions environments through tickets and custom scripts

**Strengths:**
- Full control over every environment configuration
- Deep knowledge of Allstate's specific security requirements
- Existing relationships and trust with analytics teams
- No additional licensing or vendor costs

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- 4-6 week lead time creating massive productivity bottlenecks
- Platform Engineering team overwhelmed with 200+ developer requests
- Inconsistent environments leading to "works on my machine" issues
- Manual compliance validation consuming 40+ hours per audit per team
- No cost visibility or optimization across projects
- Knowledge silos creating bus factor risks
- Reactive incident response with no proactive monitoring

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Productivity Loss:** $2.3M annually (50 engineers × 30% overhead × $150K cost)
- **Operational Overhead:** $1.2M annually (Platform team reactive support)
- **Compliance Costs:** $800K annually (manual audit prep and external consulting)
- **Infrastructure Waste:** $2M annually (over-provisioned, untracked resources)

## Alternative Internal Solutions

### Option 1: Enhanced Manual Process + Tooling
**Approach:** Improve current manual process with better scripts and documentation

**Estimated Implementation:** $300K + 6 months
**Pros:**
- Builds on existing Platform Engineering expertise
- Lower upfront investment and faster initial deployment
- Maintains current approval and governance workflows

**Cons:**
- Still requires human bottleneck for every provisioning request
- Limited scalability - can't support 2x growth in analytics teams
- No self-service capabilities for developer autonomy
- Manual processes still prone to human error and inconsistency
- Doesn't solve cost visibility or optimization challenges

**Conclusion:** Incremental improvement that doesn't solve fundamental scalability issues

### Option 2: Adopt Existing Open Source Platform (Backstage)
**Approach:** Implement Spotify's Backstage as internal developer portal

**Estimated Implementation:** $800K + 12 months
**Pros:**
- Open source with no licensing costs
- Large community and established patterns
- Extensible plugin architecture
- Modern developer experience

**Cons:**
- Requires 12+ months of engineering effort to customize for insurance compliance
- No built-in cost optimization or governance features
- Limited out-of-box analytics and ML templates
- Ongoing maintenance and security updates responsibility
- Still requires building Allstate-specific compliance automation
- Complex learning curve for Platform Engineering team

**Total Cost of Ownership:** $2.2M over 3 years (development + maintenance)

### Option 3: Expand GitHub Enterprise Usage
**Approach:** Leverage existing GitHub Enterprise investment with enhanced Actions and tooling

**Estimated Implementation:** $400K + 9 months
**Pros:**
- Builds on existing GitHub Enterprise investment and team familiarity
- Strong CI/CD and security scanning capabilities
- Established developer workflow integration
- Comprehensive audit trails and access controls

**Cons:**
- Limited infrastructure provisioning capabilities requiring custom development
- No native cost optimization or resource management
- Requires extensive custom automation for Allstate compliance workflows
- GitHub Actions not designed for complex infrastructure orchestration
- Still requires significant Platform Engineering team involvement
- No built-in analytics or ML-specific templates

**Conclusion:** Leverages existing investment but requires extensive customization

### Option 4: Microsoft Azure DevOps Enhancement
**Approach:** Expand Azure DevOps usage with custom provisioning automation

**Estimated Implementation:** $600K + 10 months
**Pros:**
- Integrates with existing Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, Office 365)
- Established project management and work tracking capabilities
- Native Azure resource provisioning and management
- Enterprise security and compliance features

**Cons:**
- Azure-centric approach limiting multi-cloud flexibility
- Complex configuration for analytics and ML workloads
- Limited policy-as-code capabilities requiring custom development
- No built-in cost optimization across cloud providers
- Requires extensive customization for insurance-specific compliance

**Conclusion:** Good Microsoft ecosystem fit but lacks analytics focus
