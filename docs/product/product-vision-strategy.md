# Product Vision & Strategy

## Allstar Forge: Internal Analytics Platform

### Executive Summary

Allstar Forge represents a strategic investment in developer productivity and operational excellence for Allstate's analytics and ML initiatives. By providing a unified, self-service Internal Developer Platform (IDP), we can accelerate project delivery, reduce compliance overhead, and establish a scalable foundation for data-driven innovation.

### Current State Analysis

**Developer Productivity Crisis:**

- Analytics teams spend 4-6 weeks provisioning new projects
- Fragmented tooling across 15+ different systems
- Manual compliance processes consuming 30% of engineering time
- Inconsistent security posture across projects
- Platform Engineering team overwhelmed supporting 200+ developers

**Quantified Impact:**

- $2.3M annual opportunity cost from delayed analytics initiatives
- $1.2M annual Platform Engineering operational overhead
- $800K annual compliance and audit preparation costs
- $2M annual infrastructure waste due to lack of optimization

### Product Vision (3-Year Horizon)

**"Enable every Allstate analytics team to provision secure, compliant, observable infrastructure efficiently, with zero security or compliance gaps."**

By 2028, Allstar Forge will be:

- The primary platform for analytics and ML workloads at Allstate
- Supporting 100+ active projects across 40+ teams
- Delivering measurable ROI through reduced operational overhead
- Serving as the foundation for Allstate's internal platform engineering capabilities

### Strategic Pillars

#### 1. Developer Velocity

- **Goal:** Reduce time-to-first-deployment from weeks to days
- **Approach:** Self-service provisioning with pre-built, compliant templates
- **Success Metric:** <24 hour median onboarding time

#### 2. Compliance by Design

- **Goal:** Automated audit-ready projects with minimal manual compliance work
- **Approach:** Policy-as-code enforcement with automated evidence collection
- **Success Metric:** Pass SOC 2/NIST audits with 90% less manual preparation

#### 3. Operational Excellence

- **Goal:** Platform reliability that enables team autonomy
- **Approach:** SLO-driven operations with monitoring and incident response
- **Success Metric:** 99.9% uptime with <2hr MTTR

#### 4. Cost Optimization

- **Goal:** Demonstrate clear ROI through reduced operational overhead
- **Approach:** Automated resource optimization and usage analytics
- **Success Metric:** 20% reduction in infrastructure spend per project

### Internal Platform Positioning

#### Current Internal Alternatives

1. **Manual Provisioning Process** (Status Quo)

   - Pros: Full control, existing team expertise, no additional licensing
   - Cons: 4-6 week delays, team bottlenecks, inconsistent outcomes

2. **Enhanced Tooling + Scripts**

   - Pros: Builds on existing investment, familiar to team
   - Cons: Still requires manual intervention, doesn't scale

3. **Adopt Backstage (Open Source)**
   - Pros: Community support, extensible architecture
   - Cons: 12+ months customization, ongoing maintenance burden

#### Differentiation Strategy

- **Analytics Optimized:** Templates and workflows specific to data/ML use cases
- **Compliance Integrated:** Built-in Allstate policy enforcement and audit trails
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Balanced automation with required approvals for risk management
- **Enterprise Integration:** Native integration with Allstate identity, audit, and SIEM systems

### Success Metrics & KPIs

#### North Star Metric

**Internal Developer Productivity Index:** Composite score including time-to-deployment, compliance coverage, incident frequency, and developer satisfaction

#### Leading Indicators

- Project onboarding velocity (weekly cohorts)
- Template adoption rate across teams
- Self-service success rate
- Policy compliance score

#### Lagging Indicators

- Developer Net Promoter Score (target: >8.0)
- Audit finding reduction (target: >60% fewer findings)
- Total cost of ownership per project
- Time to production for new analytics initiatives

### Internal Value Creation

#### Total Addressable Population (Internal)

- 400+ data engineers, analysts, and ML engineers across Allstate
- 80+ active analytics projects at any given time
- $15M annual cost base for analytics infrastructure and operations

#### Realistic Value Creation Opportunity

- **Time Savings:** 4-6 weeks → 1-2 days = $1.5M annual value
- **Compliance Automation:** 30% engineering time → <10% = $1.2M annual value
- **Infrastructure Optimization:** 15-20% cost reduction = $2M annual savings
- **Total Conservative Value:** $4.7M annual impact with $2.5M platform investment

### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-9)

Focus on core provisioning, basic compliance automation, and pilot team validation

#### Phase 2: Scale (Months 10-18)

Enterprise rollout with advanced monitoring, cost optimization, and workflow automation

#### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 19-30)

Advanced features, AI assistance, and platform ecosystem development

### Risk Acknowledgment & Mitigation

#### Technology Risk

- **Risk:** Platform complexity overwhelming initial adopters
- **Mitigation:** User-centered design, extensive pilot testing, iterative feedback

#### Adoption Risk

- **Risk:** Teams preferring existing workflows despite inefficiencies
- **Mitigation:** Champion program, executive sponsorship, clear value demonstration

#### Integration Risk

- **Risk:** Allstate system integrations proving more complex than anticipated
- **Mitigation:** Early proof-of-concept development, architecture review with IT teams

#### Timeline Risk

- **Risk:** Enterprise-grade platform taking longer than projected
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout with clear go/no-go criteria at each milestone

### Investment Rationale

This platform represents a foundational investment in Allstate's internal developer productivity and operational efficiency. The conservative 2x ROI within 24 months, combined with improved risk posture and developer satisfaction, makes this a strategic investment in scaling analytics capabilities.

**Critical Success Factors:**

- Executive sponsorship and sustained commitment
- Platform Engineering team capacity and skill development
- Early validation with champion teams
- Integration success with existing Allstate systems

**Next Steps:**

- Detailed technical architecture review with IT Security
- Pilot team selection and onboarding strategy
- Baseline measurement establishment for current processes
- Resource allocation and team formation planning
