**Reality Check:**

- Similar platforms (Backstage customization) typically take 12-18 months for MVP
- Enterprise security and compliance review adds 3-6 months
- Integration testing and production hardening often doubles development time
- Team size may be insufficient for parallel development of multiple complex features

**Questions:**

- What's the definition of "MVP" - basic functionality or production-ready?
- How much time is allocated for security reviews and compliance validation?
- What happens if key integrations take longer than expected?
- Are there dependencies on other teams that could delay timeline?

### 7. Platform Engineering Team Capacity

**Question:** Can current Platform Engineering team support both existing operations and new platform development?

**Current State:**

- Platform Engineering team currently overwhelmed with manual provisioning
- 60% of time spent on reactive support
- New platform would require ongoing maintenance and feature development
- Team skills may need updating for modern platform technologies

**Concerns:**

- Developing new platform while maintaining current operations could burn out team
- Platform expertise in Temporal, Crossplane, service mesh may require training/hiring
- Support burden during rollout could overwhelm available capacity
- Knowledge transfer from manual processes to automated platform not planned

**Validation Needed:**

- Skills gap analysis for Platform Engineering team
- Capacity planning during transition period
- Training and professional development budget requirements
- Contingency planning if key team members leave during development
